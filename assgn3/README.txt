B) All parts of the assignment are working to our knowledge.
C) Our approach to testing was to first make something that passed the example, then make test-case text files for each rotation.
We kept working on the code, debugging with our IDE's debugger, until we had something that passed all of the test-cases we made.

If it weren't for the test cases we wrote, we could have submitted some broken double-rotation code, because the provided test did not test for it.
But, we caught the issue and eventually fixed it.

As for how we made sure it was asymptotically efficient, there is only one loop in the program that we made ourselves.
We determined, the time complexity of the loop to be O(log n).
